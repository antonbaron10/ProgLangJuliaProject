Code


Transferred Covid viz code to colab for viewing convenience, started there but switched to an IDE because was very slow on Colab
* If you have Julia installed and actually want to run the code on your machine without waiting forever for colab go to code folder, atom, and download the .jl files

Run dv.jl (just to import the packages ignore anything else) then run clean.jl for the code

The cvs file is updated constantly and sometimes is corrupted ... Occasionally running clean.jl doesn't work so see colab because csv file was fine as of creating that


** If code is suddenly not working when it has worked in the past (& you're using an IDE), try ending the Julia session and starting a new one. It's also a good idea to keep one file for all of your package imports/installations in the same directory as any files you're running at the same time. Importing packages, "using" statements often conflict with eachother and can cause problems

download screenshots (can't see from preview) in atom folder to see use of GL and RDatasets packages (shows code & resulting plots)
