Transferred code to colab for viewing convenience, started there but switched to an IDE because was very slow on Colab
* If you have Julia installed and actually want to run the code on your machine without waiting forever for colab go to code folder, atom, and download the .jl files

Run dv.jl (just to import the packages ignore anything else) then run clean.jl for the code

The cvs file is updated constantly and sometimes is corrupted ... Occasionally running clean.jl doesn't work so see colab because csv file was fine as of creating that
